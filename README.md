Calculate the propagation constant of a tapered fiber and a whispering-gallery-mode.

[1] Phase-matched excitation of whispering-gallery-mode resonances by a fiber taper, Knight, J. C.

[2] Asymptotic expansion of morphological resonance frequencies in Mie scattering, S. Schiller

Note: notation used to denote mode numbers differ between [1] and [2]:

    ==============================
    Mode Number |    [1]  |   [2]
    ==============================
    Radial      |     n    |   l
    Angular     |     l    |   m
    Azimuthal   |     m    |   n
    
This code uses the definitions in [1] for consistency.
